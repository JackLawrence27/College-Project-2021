Fixes:

1.03 (Jack)
+	Reworked mouse click left on the menus so it only works when you are hovering over the menu element.
	Before you could do it anywhere on the screen and it would transition.
+	Fixed where the player would sometimes get stuck in the wall due to the changing hitboxes of the sprites. Made them similar to fix 

1.04 (Dale)
+	Re-fixed the player getting stuck in walls at corners (can still get stuck when jumping and colliding from underneath)

+	Fixed being able to see out the top of the map.

1.07 (Jack)
+	Fixed weird main menu selected bug changing randomly

1.08 (Dale)
+   Removed the pitch in the scroll sound (I think it sounds more consistent)
+	Made the Menu music carry over to the levels (i think we should have steady rise on the music, nice and calm for the first few levels, getting more intense as the game gets harder)
+	Fixed a bug where you could fly after jumping then punching


Known Bugs:

+	Player can still get stuck when jumping and colliding from underneath.


//Secondary Ideas/Todo List

Ideas:
+	Room with no oxygen with a time limit to complete
+	Room with toxic corrosion parts that you need to uncorrode (some kind of Purify element) - a door you need to pass through which is covered in flames, you need to uncorrode the pipe, and then turn on the valve to allow water to flow and put out the fire
+	Rooms with blockades to destroy to pass (some sort of explosion/fire element)

ToDo:
+	Final design changes
+	Chop off the "Ending" to the "Menu Music" so it repeats more smoothly.
+	Add Crow as a guide to the teleporter on rm_1

Done:
+	Animate clouds
+	Animate lava in background sprite for level 1
+	Make Coin Counter more noticable on level 1
+	Added sound effects to main menu#
